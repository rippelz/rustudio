//! Play (F5), Run (F8) and Stop (Shift+F5).
//!
//! Play runs two DataModels like a Roblox test session: the **server** (a
//! deep copy of the edit DataModel, running Scripts and physics) and one
//! **client** (a replicated copy without ServerStorage / ServerScriptService
//! contents, running LocalScripts). Server changes stream to the client
//! every frame; client changes stay local, except the character, which the
//! client owns (its movement is written to both sides). Remotes carry calls
//! across. Run (F8) is the server alone. Stop restores the edit DataModel.
//!
//! While a session runs, the editor shows one side (`showing`); the other
//! waits in `other_doc`. Each tick puts the server in front, works, and puts
//! the chosen side back.
