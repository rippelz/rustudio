**A native Linux/Windows Roblox Studio, written in Rust.** Open, edit and save
Roblox places, press Play and run them with real Luau, physics, characters
and GUIs, without Wine.

Rustudio is very much a beta/prototype, I wouldn't call it a studio replacement
quite yet.

> This project is still early, so please please help!! Contributions are super welcome. Come hang out, ask for help or report bugs on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/pdVZpADpWr).

## Features

- **Editor:** Explorer, Properties, Output, script tabs, move/scale/rotate
  tools, terrain tools, undo/redo, and Studio's menus, ribbon and shortcuts.
- **Files:** `.rbxl` / `.rbxlx` places and `.rbxm` / `.rbxmx` models, plus
  project folders (`*.project.json` with plain files as the source of truth,
  Rojo/Argon sync rules, `sourcemap.json`, and File > Save as Project
  Folder… to turn any place into one).
- **Play / Run:** separate server and client, remotes, physics (rapier3d),
  R15/R6 characters and animation, sounds, tweens, 2D and 3D GUIs.
- **Luau:** the real Luau VM, with most of the engine API that real games
  call (see [docs/ENGINE-GAPS.md](docs/ENGINE-GAPS.md) for what's missing).
- **Rendering:** wgpu, with lighting, shadows, sky, atmosphere and materials
  tuned against Studio. Meshes, FBX import and terrain are supported.
- **Roblox account:** open your places, load assets and avatars, use
  DataStores, and join Team Create sessions.

## Install

You need a Rust toolchain (1.85+) and a GPU with Vulkan (or OpenGL). On
Linux, the sign-in window also needs WebKitGTK 4.1 (`webkit2gtk-4.1` on Arch,
`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu); Windows uses the WebView2 runtime
it already has.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rippelz/rustudio
cd rustudio
cargo build --release
./target/release/rustudio --demo           # sample scene
./target/release/rustudio my_place.rbxl    # open a place
```

On Windows (MSVC toolchain), run `.\target\release\rustudio.exe` instead,
and see the Windows notes under [Platforms](#platforms).

On first launch rustudio downloads Roblox Studio's built-in content
(default characters, camera and control scripts, fonts, textures, sounds;
about 60 MB) from Roblox's own CDN into `~/.local/share/rustudio/studio`
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\rustudio\studio` on Windows).
To get it ahead of time, or update it, run
`rustudio --install-studio-content`.

If you already have Studio installed (e.g. via
[Vinegar](https://vinegarhq.org)), you can point rustudio at that instead:

```sh
export RUSTUDIO_STUDIO_DIR=~/.var/app/org.vinegarhq.Vinegar/data/vinegar/versions/version-XXXX
```

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 (Wayland or X11) | Supported, and the only one tested |
| Linux ARM64 | Should build; untested |
| macOS | Not supported yet (untested, likely needs small fixes) |
| Windows x86_64 (MSVC) | Builds and runs (tested on Windows 11); see below |

CI checks every push on Linux and Windows.

Windows is new, so a few things don't work there yet:

- Paths in this README are the Linux ones. On Windows, data and caches go
  in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rustudio` (e.g. the Studio content download in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rustudio\studio`) and settings in `%APPDATA%\rustudio`.
- Signing in is untested (the session cookie still goes through
  `secret-tool`).
- Video playback is off (libvpx/libopus are loaded only on Linux), and a
  native crash doesn't write a crash report (panics still do).

## Signing in

Everything above works signed out. To open your own places or load private
assets, sign in with your Roblox session: use the account button at the top
right and **Sign in with Roblox** (Roblox's own login page, in a window), paste
the `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie there, or put it in `~/.config/rustudio/roblox-cookie`
(`chmod 600`). rustudio stores it in your login keyring. Details are in
[docs/AUTH.md](docs/AUTH.md).
